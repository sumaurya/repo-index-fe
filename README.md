Application Start Instructions -
1) from the project directory, execute 
ng serve --prod
2) In browser, navigate to http://localhost:4200
3) Start by adding repository and than keep on going.


Limitations of the system - 
The pair of Applications has few limitations - 
1) only http repository links are supported not any other protocol.
e.g use following repository to test -
name - iitm
url - http://ftp.iitm.ac.in/cran/src/contrib/
2) there few UI bugs like, the repositoryListComponent is loaded twice on first load. And one of the component html is visible accross all pages.
3) styling is not proper

FYI : I have not got the opportunity to work on front-end yet. I request you to please consider this point as well.
I found this task a good learning opportunity. I had also prepared another version using ng2-smart-table which has more functionality but it also had more bugs. I would love to discuss that as well if I get the opportunity.

Please reach out to me on linked-in/email for any clarification -
